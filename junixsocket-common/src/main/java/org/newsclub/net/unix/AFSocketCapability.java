 * Describes junixsocket capabilities the current environment (system platform, native library,

 *
 * You can check whether your environment supports a given capability by calling
 * {@link AFSocket#supports(AFSocketCapability)}.
 *
 * You can also manually disable a given capability by specifying a System property of the form
 * <code>org.newsclub.net.unix.library.disable.<em>CAPABILITY_SOMETHING_SOMETHING</em>=true</code>
 * when invoking the JVM (make sure this property is set before junixsocket is accessed).
 *
 * A simple way to check which capabilities are supported in an environment is to run the
 * `junixsocket-selftest` jar.
