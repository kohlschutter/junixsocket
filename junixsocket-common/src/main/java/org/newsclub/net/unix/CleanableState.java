/**
 * This wrapper (along with the Java 8-specific counterpart in src/main/java8) allows us to
 * implement cleanup logic for objects that are garbage-collectable/no longer reachable.
 *
 * <p>
 * Usage:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Create a subclass of CleanableState and attach it as a private field to the object you want
 * to be cleaned up. You may call that field {@code cleanableState}.</li>
 * <li>Define all resources that need to be cleaned up in this subclass (instead of the observed
 * object itself).</li>
 * <li>Make sure to not refer the observed object instance itself, as that will create a reference
 * cycle and prevent proper cleanup.</li>
 * <li>Implement the {@link #doClean()} method to perform all the necessary cleanup steps.</li>
 * <li>If the observed class implements {@code close()}, it's a good practice to have it just call
 * {@code cleanableState.runCleaner()}.</li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementation details:
 * <ul>
 * <li>In Java 9 or later, {@link Cleaner} is used under the hood.</li>
 * <li>In Java 8 or earlier, {@link #finalize()} calls {@link #doClean()} directly.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
