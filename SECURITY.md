# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Note that the Apache 2.0 licensed junixsocket project comes with absolutely no warranties or
conditions of any kind.  That said, we try our best to remedy any security issues as soon as
possible.

Should a security issue arise, a fix would usually be included in a PATCH or MINOR version update,
i.e., 2.6.1 -> 2.6.2 or 2.7.0.

If you depend on an outdated version of junixsocket or need other commercial support, please reach
out to directly to Christian Kohlschütter (email is in `pom.xml`).

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.6.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 2.6.x | Commercial support available |
| < 2.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through GitHub issues!

Instead, please reach out directly to Christian Kohlschütter (email is in `pom.xml`); be sure to
include the phrase `SECURITY ISSUE` in the email subject.

You should usually receive a response within 3 business days.

This project follows a 90 day disclosure timeline.
