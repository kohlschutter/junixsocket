       * the same address will cause the first server to terminate, and the new server will take
       * over the address. Depending on the operating system, this may involve connecting to the
       * first server in order to "wake up" the accept call.
       *
       * In this demo code, we use AFSocket.getConnectionStatus to see if the accepted connection is
       * alive by sending
       *
       * When "reuseAddress" is false, attempting to bind while another server is running won't
       * disrupt the first connection. The second bind will throw a SocketException instead.
       *
       * NOTE: "reuseAddress=true" may not yet be supported on certain operating systems, such as
       * IBM i and z/OS. On these platforms, the behavior is as if "reuseAddress=false". Please
       * reach out by filing an issue on https://github.com/kohlschutter/junixsocket/issues if this
